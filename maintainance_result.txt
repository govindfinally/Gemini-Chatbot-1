### Summary of OpenAI

OpenAI is a leading American artificial intelligence (AI) research and deployment company. Its stated mission is to ensure that **artificial general intelligence (AGI)**—AI systems that are generally smarter than humans—benefits all of humanity.

Founded in 2015, OpenAI has been a central force in the recent AI boom, transitioning advanced AI from a niche academic field to a mainstream global technology.

**Key Points:**

*   **Famous Products:** OpenAI is best known for creating groundbreaking AI models that are accessible to the public, including:
    *   **ChatGPT:** A highly popular conversational chatbot that can answer questions, write essays, code, and more.
    *   **GPT Models (e.g., GPT-4):** The powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) that power ChatGPT and are used by developers worldwide to build their own AI applications.
    *   **DALL-E:** An AI model that can generate unique and realistic images and art from simple text descriptions.
    *   **Sora:** A newer model capable of creating high-definition, realistic videos from text prompts.

*   **Structure and Partnerships:** Originally founded as a non-profit, OpenAI later created a "capped-profit" subsidiary to raise the immense capital needed for large-scale AI research. It has a multi-billion dollar partnership with **Microsoft**, which provides crucial funding and cloud computing power.

*   **Impact on the World:** OpenAI is largely responsible for kickstarting the current generative AI race. The public release of ChatGPT in late 2022 made millions of people aware of the power of modern AI, forcing major tech companies to accelerate their own AI development.

In short, OpenAI is a pioneering company that develops some of the world's most advanced AI technologies, making them widely available while navigating the complex challenges of safety and ethics in the pursuit of human-level intelligence.
